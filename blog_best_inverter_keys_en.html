    <h1>Invest our capital</h1>
        <p>Many of you who read this thread probably do not know anything about stock or stock.
            But perhaps if you have had or seen a relative with business in hand who has put his money in such land or in a trade.
            All this is important to reduce the risk of failure as low as possible. You have to focus on capital to invest, demand and debt in case you are going to ask for a loan.
            If you are going to receive a loan, the most advisable thing is that the business has started to give the expected benefits in a year and that the debt can be paid with the benefits at most 3 years.
            If these premises are not fulfilled perhaps the business is not worth it and it is better to look for other options.
            Taking into account all this we should diversify the capital in different branches. <br />
            In the following chart I expose a very conservative diversification with most assets invariable in time (jewels and goods (these may vary depending on the purchase made), and shares or currency (deposit)</p>
    <img class="horiz_big" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SERGIOLM/diariodeuningeniero/gh-pages/imgs/eco/capital_diversify_d.jpg" alt=”capital_diversify” /><br />
    <ul>
        <li>
            The <strong> bank deposit </strong> is like having our money in a specific currency and with a specific annual interest.
            If we are in Spain, country with low risk of recession and bankrupt, with a strong euro the risk is very low and if we are in a Spanish bank with an amount less than 100,000 euros, it would be a near zero risk.       </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Fixed income or government bonds </strong> (very low risk but in specific periods of time can be high profitability (2012-2015 period). Low risk with 30% potential and 15% risk of losses.
        <li>
            <strong>Equities (stock, securities) </strong>, depends on the skill of the investor. For me the risk is the smallest of all here shown
        <li>
            <strong>Goods (housing or objects)</strong> depends on when you buy and in what area in the case of housing and if they are valuable objects as pictures is very subjective but there are also strategies.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Gold u jewelery </strong>, if we are at the gates of a global recession may be the best investment of all exposed.
            In case of a stable economy, it is revalued according to inflation more or less. Very low risk.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the case of the bag, something similar occurs. The actions can often not be profitable quickly, but if there are technical markers to know when it is time to enter avoiding risks.
        When a stock falls a lot, it does not mean that the rebound is going to be hit hard and although there is a high probability of making a lot of money in a short time also to continue losing it.
        The intention to put money in the stock market is not to earn money at once if not to avoid losing it in the long run, more if you do not understand stock market.
        With this mentality the returns can be substantial. To evaluate a stock market value there are two ways to look at it. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>From the point of view of the company seeing your economic data, expenses, debt and profit over time. All this is called <strong> fundamental analysis </strong>. </li>
         <li> And from a <strong> technical point of view </strong>, considering how the action has behaved over time and how it has reacted to good and bad events.
        In addition to the analysis by means (MACD) and to different indicators like the accumulation of the action, number of orders of purchase daily sales, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But the key in the stock market is the distribution of capital, or as it is called <strong> diversification </strong>.
    We can never be 100% safe in the stock market, normally the price at which it is quoted is the price at which time the company is worth, counting the price of all the shares.
    In most cases, this subjective price does not correspond to reality at all and it will be the investor's job to know if that company is overvalued or undervalued.
    Usually time puts all businesses on your site.
    Many times the value is quoted above its value, not because it is expected to improve the company if not for reasons of certain individuals who own great capital inside.
    At the moment you want to throw the action down you can fall and hard so it is not good to have more than 10% on a particular value.<br /><br />

     Besides not having all our capital in a specific company we must also diversify and not group the actions in a specific sector.
    If a mineral is lowered and we have it in mines the most normal thing is that they lower all ones in greater or worse measure.
    Just like this if a bank goes down for some macroeconomic event, many banks will come down.
    If a bank collapses or bankruptcy can affect several banks to a sufficient extent since it is all interconnected. That is why it is advisable to distribute by sector.
    Below I show the example portfolio that I would recommend to minimize risk to the maximum.
    It is better made for the current situation, if not the banking and financial sector should be less, since it entails its risks but now we are before the start of interest rates in the euro zone.
    This will benefit the banks.<br /><br />
     <img class="horiz_big" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SERGIOLM/diariodeuningeniero/gh-pages/imgs/eco/variable_diversify_d.jpg" alt=”variable_diversify” /><br />
    There are sectors that are cyclical and behave well in a range of time and in another range begin to decline, is the case of mining or steel or banking case. <br /> <br />
    Next, I will review the IBEX35 to explain how sectors are diversified in index.
    At present the level of the IBEX35 is somewhat swollen and it will have to correct although it is of those that more potential have in the medium term.<br /><br />

    It is also advisable to diversify by countries and currencies, although the Spanish case currently presents no risk.
    While there are emerging countries with companies that have more potential and could have a 15% portfolio in these countries.</p>

    <h2>Cyclic Sectors</h2>
    <br />
    <ul>
        <li>
            The <strong> mining or steel industry </strong> started to rebound in 2016 and there have been close returns to 100% or 200% in many of these companies these two years.
            Now it is in a mature stage, they are still raised but the risk is higher than when they were in minimums. <br />
            In this group in the IBEX we can find stocks like <strong> ACERINOX or ARCELORMITTAL </strong>, both with an upward trend flawless.
            Between these two is much more robust ACERINOX, since it has behaved much better before the fall of the price of the metals the last years. <br />
            Moreover, in this particular case, it is also because ACERINOX is a company that works the metal and does not sell it as such, giving it added value.
            That is why the fall of metals is something less. <br /> <br />
            On the other hand we also find REPSOL, which has doubled its value from the lowest, although here there is a high risk as the geopolitical tensions between OPEC producers and the United States is remarkable.
            A big drop in prices could occur at any time so I would not recommend going into stocks like that.
            Companies that depend on raw materials have a high risk because they fluctuate a lot both for good and for bad.
            In the present case with a good entry by technician it could be advantageous to have no more than 15% of portfolio value. <br />
            In the field of oil and gas industry wwe have <strong> TECNICAS REUNIDAS </strong>, which 2 years ago underwent an important adjustment due to not fulfilling the prospects.
            That drop could be the indicator needed to move the value again and I already recovered the value I had previously.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <strong> banking sector </strong> is also cyclical and has been in a bullish phase since the crash occurred in 2008.
            Although with some timely changes in time that caused them to fall the price of the same as in the case of Brexit or the crisis in OPEP in early 2016 that finally was nothing more than a warning.
            Right now things look very good in the banking sector as the type 0 policy seems to be coming to an end and we could see a much more restrictive policy with the money in which banks are the main beneficiaries.
            And the most disadvantaged those companies with a high debt. So here I would recommend entering up to 30% of the value in the portfolio.
            Of all the banks in the Spanish sector, <strong> SANTANDER, BBVA, BANKIA, BSABADELL, CAIXABANK or POPULAR </strong>, I see better management and better entry price in BANKIA.
        </li>
        <li>
            Another interesting cyclical sector is <strong> construction </strong> that is now starting to take off and a new impetus is expected when Trump announces its new infrastructure plan.
            The most benefited companies would be those multinationals with presence in the United States as <strong>ACS or FERROVIAL. </strong><br />
            Spain has quite advanced companies in this field and many are in a clear bullish moment like <strong> SACYR </strong> that has stopped its minimal rebound stage.
        </li>
    </ul>>
    <h2>Non cyclic sectors</h2>
    <br />
    <ul>
        <li>
            In this case we would have <strong> energy or electric companies </strong> that are in very good shape in Spain because they have the backing of the government.
            The increases are staggered and have been in the bullish trend for several years with constant and sound benefits.
            This is the case of <strong> ENDESA, IBERDROLA and GAS NATURAL as well as RED ELECTRICA </strong>.<br />
            Other power companies with an unstoppable bullish trend are <strong>GAMESA </strong> which unlike the previous ones has not had favorable treatment and has a good value thanks to the management of the same.
            GAMESA had to deal with the crisis of the renewable ones after the government of Zapatero and has multiplied its value exponentially until today, to such an extent that it has merged with SIEMENS recently.
            With the aim of being a leader in its field.<br /><br />
            Another Spanish renewable company is <strong> ABENGOA </strong> that could be the antagonistic case to GAMESA. With a bad management by the management team have been about to sink the company.
            Currently the company is led by Urquijo and other renowned directors of Spain who will do the unspeakable to recover the position that deserves.
            This company has recently made a dilution of the value of its shares, losing the shareholders and creditors almost the total of the money invested.
            Right now, the stock does not reflect the value of the company at all and could be a clear sign of entry into value.
            After the storm, although the risk is still high in the company, the information I have about it indicates otherwise.
            While there are many things still in the air that can make you vary a lot from what we are talking about so the risk is high.
        </li>
        <li>
            Another non-cyclical sector would be <strong> the technological </strong> with few representative Spanish stock exchanges, as Spain has never been good in that field.
            As an exponent, we would have <strong> INDRA </strong>, a rather state-owned company. Its value is rather lateral and for nothing is a value in which to risk the money as it is moved by 4 people with insider information.
            In addition the risk of losing is more than winning, there are many foreign technology companies with better prospects and more transparent data.
            On the other hand we have <strong> TELEFONICA </strong>, Spanish telecommunications company of the largest IBEX. While the prospects of this company are bearers in the long term.
            It has numerous financial problems and profits have been declining over the years as the monopoly has ended and the European Union's umbrella has been disappearing.
            In addition, the high debt of the company may be a problem that is yet to come, with the rate increases that are coming. A value to be for technical reasons and not recommended in the long term.
            Other smaller companies with high potential as a technician have been opted for the big ones like INDRA, so in this sector we see few options because if one company stands out, it will not take long to be opted or merged with another.</li>
        <li>
            In <strong> the consumption sector </strong> we could find <strong> INDITEX and DIA </strong> as representatives in Spain.
            INDITEX with an impeccable trend since its birth now presents some risk to be so great and be so capitalized so that no matter how bullish it carries its risk.<br />
            DIA is rather young on the stock market and has quite a good outlook at the current price.<br />
           <ul>
                <li>
                    Sometimes cars look like a sector of their own but I see it more as a piece of the consumption sector.
                    In Spain we do not have an automobile company, although it is true that we have more factories and jobs in this sector than in countries that are home to automobile companies.<br />
                    Instead, I add another sector that is often included in consumption, such as the tourism and transportation sector, as well as the doctor and journalist.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Another interesting sector is <strong> the tourist </strong> with great prospects in companies. The hotel chain <strong> MELIA and NHHOTELES </strong> stands out.
                    They have an impeccable upward trend and an assured annual return.
                    In addition to the transportation that is vital in tourism, we find companies like  <strong>AENA </strong>, backed by the government that has tripled its value since it went public 3 years ago with a bullish trend that seems to have no end.
                    We also find <strong> IAG </strong>, former IBERIA, Spanish and British airline with enough clouds due to the BREXIT that thanks to the low oil prices of these years has come out very benefited.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Here too the <strong> medical and pharmaceutical </strong> sector with <strong> GRIFOLS </strong> leads in Spain with good long-term prospects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We also have <strong> the media sector </strong> with big groups like <strong> VOCENTO, PRISA or MEDIASET </strong> with good results.
                    Although they have had to adjust their benefits and make a transfer to the digital era that is coming up, taking income from advertising on the internet.
