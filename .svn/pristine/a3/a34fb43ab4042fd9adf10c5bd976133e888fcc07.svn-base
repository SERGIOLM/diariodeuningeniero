	<p> Toulouse also called Toulouse in antiquity is the most populated French city closest to Spain.
	At present, the city has become a veritable European metropolis comparable with Lyon, Marseille, Frankfurt or Dublin.
	More than a metropolis, Toulouse consolidates itself as a technopolis specialized in aeronautics, the aerospace industry, telecommunications and the medical sector.</br>
	It has 1.3 million inhabitants and is one of the fastest growing in France, both in population and in industries and services.
	It is also called the pink city by the color of the old buildings, made with bricks. </br>
	The climate is one of the best in France, so it is the destination of many French people from more northern areas who are looking for a place to work with more quality of life. </p>

	<h1>History</h1>
	<img class="right_small" src="http://i235.photobucket.com/albums/ee43/Sergio22/emprender_fr/country_fr/toulouse_fr/capitolio.jpg" border="0" alt=" capitolio"/>
	<p>City of Roman origin, already has a history of more than 2000 years. Although a settlement had already existed for many centuries before.
	In Toulouse pre-Roman lived Gallic towns, Volks Tectosabios.
	It was the capital of the Visigoths, those who stayed in our country in the fifth century.
	Later they would be of the Franks that would occupy the city by many centuries avoiding that the Arabs extended by Europe.
	It was also the city where Protestant religions differed from those of Northern Europe of the Catholic religion.

	In the twentieth century it was the site of the aviation armaments industry in World War II. </p>


	<h1>Capital of Europe's aeronautics</h1>
	<p>Toulouse has been an important city in this industry since the beginning of the 19th century when most of the industries in this sector are established there.
	Most of the first engineers and inventors were working in this city, like Clément Ader.
	The whole industry expands to the west of Blagnac airport, to Colombiers, a city that is striking with Toulouse. </br>
	Toulouse stands out as well as aeronautics and the aerospace industry in telecommunications and the medical sector.
	This economic dynamism (high employment growth) entails a strong demographic increase, which leads to a profound variation of its infrastructures, dwellings and industries.
	Indeed, Toulouse is the European capital of aeronautics and space industries, but continues to diversify especially in the field of medical research.
	In it are the main quarters of AIRBUS, part of EADS that is dedicated mainly to the design and manufacture of airplanes.
	It is where the world's largest AIRBUS commercial airplane, A380. Its parts arrive from another larger plane, Beluga aircraft.</p>
