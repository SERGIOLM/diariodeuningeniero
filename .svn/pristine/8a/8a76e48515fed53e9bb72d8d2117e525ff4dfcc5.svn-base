			<p>The origin of the name is uncertain but London comes from the Roman Londinium and may come from the way the river.

			Passing the fifth century London was abandoned and years after that became a mere Anglo-Saxon settlement with about 12,000 inhabitants.</br>

			These population increases would be diminished with the plagues that beset Europe and that London would not come out unscathed.
			Around 1750 Buckingham Palace would be built by King George III of that time, the residence of the present Queen of England, Elizabeth II.</br></br>

			In the nineteenth century, London became a benchmark of global city being the capital of the British Empire and the world's largest city, which would record until 1925 when cities
			US outstrip that figure. In London the industrial revolution began building a vast network of railways managed to reduce traffic in	the city.
			Due to the conquests and discoveries of the British Empire have taken away a lot of jewelry, art and archaeological remains that would rise much more.
			London became one of the world leaders in terms of research and science, universities were related world long before the United States, with Oxford and Cambridge to the head, which is
			far from London no more than 100 miles. </br> </br>

		<h1>Great museums</h1>
		<img class="right_small2" src="http://i235.photobucket.com/albums/ee43/Sergio22/emprender_uk/country_uk/london/museums.jpg"  alt="museums"  />
		<p>London has many unique museums in the world.

		The Archaeological Museum with one of the largest collections dinosaurs and fossils in the world. It has also a extended collection of the animal and botanical world and  as well as minerals and meteorites, below picture.</br></br></br>

		<p>	<img class="right_small" src="http://i235.photobucket.com/albums/ee43/Sergio22/emprender_uk/country_uk/london/parlament.jpg"  alt="parlament"  />
		London has several architectural gems, although almost all of the last 600 years because of that fortified medieval town barely tower king and part of the wall remains.
		St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey are those part of the London charm and the famous Parliament and curious clock tower in the world and inspired several films and novels like Sherlock Holmes.
		It also has magnificent famous parks in the world as Hyde Park or Regent's Park where is the London zoo and botanical park a few years ago was the best in the world.
		Besides these two centuries has other buildings like Albert Hall and some other neoclassical building as the Guild Hall in the heart of London.</p></br></br>

		<p><img class="right_small2" src="http://i235.photobucket.com/albums/ee43/Sergio22/emprender_uk/country_uk/london/camden.jpg"  alt="camden"  />
		London is home to many cultures and lifestyles, and there is great social inequality among the poorest who can work in the center but live in the suburbs and richer than even making fortunes can
		not make ends meet because of the high cost of leisure in general, which can be a 500% more than a city like Madrid.</br></br>
		But wages are not 5 times but maybe about 3 times more for the same position.
		Only those who work in the City really have enough salary to afford every whim in central London, where a measly A1 renting a room of 40 square meters can be about 3000 pounds a month.
		In the center inhabit different communities with different religions or social groups. The best example is Camden Town, a place full tourist district of different shops and where typical food is served from anywhere on the continent.</p></br></br>
